Transformer for chaotic trajectory


This repository implements a transformer-based framework to learn and reproduce statistical features of chaotic trajectories from time-series data, with a physics case study on quenched dynamics in the 1D semiclassical Holstein model. See arXiv:2601.19080 for the full method and results: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19080
